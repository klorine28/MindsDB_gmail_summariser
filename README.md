<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project entails using the Mindsdb tool to make Gmail and Slack databases to then utilise their ML/LLM capabilities in order to make a very capable summarise bot.

Here's why:
* your time is very important and getting a summary of your Emails will allow you to stay productive.
* You shouldn't be losing time on checking your email constantly so automate it with this bot
* You can make this as bespoke as you want this bot is quite brad and accepting of customization

Of course, this bot may not be exactly what you are looking for, but it hopefully becomes a template you change in order to make something amazing that works for you.
